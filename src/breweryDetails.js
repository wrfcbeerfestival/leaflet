Two friends, Tim Coombes and Mark Gloyens, had gone through school together at Sir William Borlase, at a time when the old Wethered brewery was in full production with the smell and noise from the brewery clearly marking Marlow out to locals and visitors alike as a brewing town. Having discussed the idea to set up in business together earlier in their careers, and watching the old brewery close, the idea started to take shape of reviving Marlow tradition in 1991. After a couple of years of planning, research and failed attempts to secure small premises on the old brewery site, which was owned by Whitbreads, the Rebellion Brewery was established on the Rose Industrial Estate in Marlow Bottom in April 1993. In 1999 the brewery moved to its current premises on Bencombe Farm, occupying the old grainstore and other redundant farm buildings.',
