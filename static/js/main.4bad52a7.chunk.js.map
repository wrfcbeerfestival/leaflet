Having discussed the idea to set up in business together earlier in their careers, and watching the old brewery close, the idea started to take shape of reviving Marlow tradition in 1991. After a couple of years of planning, research and failed attempts to secure small premises on the old brewery site, which was owned by Whitbreads, the Rebellion Brewery was established on the Rose Industrial Estate in Marlow Bottom in April 1993. In 1999 the brewery moved to its current premises on Bencombe Farm, occupying the old grainstore and other redundant farm buildings.',\n      list: [{\n        name: 'Wrens',\n        notes: 'An extra pale malt base provides the ideal clean canvas for the spectacular US big hitters Mosaic, Citra and Simcoe hops.

This being our 6th event, we continue to grow not just in our selections of Beer and Cider, but in other aspects of the festival. Our 7’s tournament looks to be our biggest yet.</p>\n    <p>Last year I wrote a small introduction calling myself a Salmon. As you can guess a year on and I haven’t lived that down. Instead let's introduce some new faces of the WRFC family. Mr Ryan Dalton and his team. You may have noticed our clubhouse looks a bit different and that is due to their fine work. Here is a few words from Ryan;\n    </p>\n    <p>“Hello Beer & Cider lovers! My team and I have been working hard since last September to turn Watford Rugby Club into a unique social venue for the community that stretches further than just rugby. The mission isn’t over yet but we are getting there day by day, whilst most importantly, having fun along the way! After attending the beer festival last year, I have witnessed first hand the fantastic work Jon and the club done. Hopefully together we can make this years event the best yet!”\n</p>\n    <p>Now onto the event. As I said last year, I love it! I am a massive cider drinker and our range goes from strength to strength. Of course #beestingfriday will always have a place in my heart, but if you have the pleasure of trying Mango last year, you know the competition for festival favourite is stiff! However this year, I think we might have a few more dark horses; Cherry & Pineapple, Orange & Cinnamon and Pomegranate & Rose. I hope you will join me in trying them all.\n</p>\n    <p>Our event is only as good as it is thanks to the people who help out. The volunteers working the event keeping everyone nice and drunk, all the MMJ parents who cover the saturday shift so the seniors can run around in our pretty outfits pretending to play rugby. The guys who helped promote the event. The refs who step up every year, to ensure we have the highest standard of rugby, and are no way influenced by the number of jagers they are bought. Thank you to Sue for helping with the printing and Amber for all the design work. A huge thank you to our sponsors, the original Salmon Mr Geoff Hicks, and to all the people behind the scenes. Finally to Clint, a man who takes its on his shoulders, trying every single beer (multiple times) to ensure they are of the highest quality!\n</p>\n    <p>And finally to you. Without you here we wouldn’t have an event. You are the most important part of the whole festival.
